            <p>This policy outlines the terms related to refunds for funds deposited to your SLOption account. It is important to understand that all financial transactions on the platform are considered final.</p>

            <h2>1. Deposits</h2>
            <p>When you deposit funds into your "Real Wallet," they are instantly credited for the sole purpose of placing trades. A refund of a deposit will only be considered under exceptional circumstances, such as a verifiable technical error during the deposit process, and only if <strong>no trading activity has occurred</strong> with the deposited funds. All such requests are subject to a thorough review and are processed at the sole discretion of SLOption.</p>

            <h2>2. Trade Outcomes</h2>
            <p><strong>Losses from trading are strictly non-refundable.</strong></p>
            <p>Placing a trade is a high-risk activity where you fully accept the possibility of losing your bid amount. The outcome of a trade, whether a win or a loss, is final and determined by real-time market data. We do not issue refunds for trades that result in a loss under any circumstances.</p>

            <h2>3. Withdrawals</h2>
            <p>The withdrawal of available funds from your "Real Wallet" is not a refund. It is a separate process governed by our Terms & Conditions, allowing you to retrieve your available balance. This is subject to our standard review and processing procedures.</p>

            <h2>4. How to Request a Refund for a Deposit Error</h2>
            <p>If you believe you are eligible for a refund due to a technical error with a deposit transaction, you must contact our support team within 24 hours of the transaction. Please provide all relevant details for our review.</p>
